Colors

Do not trust color just for what you see,
Its shade may veil a whisper lost in hue;
Hue hides the heart of what the world might be.

Though red may burn with warmth and certainty,
Its flame conceals the storm it’s burning through—
Do not trust color just for what you see.

Blue speaks in calm, but not with honesty,
It drowns its grief in oceans none can view;
Hue hides the heart of what the world might be.

Green sings of life and breath and canopy,
Yet roots may rot beneath the morning dew—
Do not trust color just for what you see.

Gold blinds with truth’s imagined clarity,
But masks the cost of all it once outgrew;
Hue hides the heart of what the world might be.

And black, though feared, holds truth and dignity,
A cloak for stars, for ink, for depths we knew—
Do not trust color just for what you see.
Hue hides the heart of what the world might be.
