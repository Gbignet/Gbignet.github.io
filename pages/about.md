# **About Me**
<div style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.6">

</p>

<p>I am a <span style="font-font-weight: bold; font-weight: 700;"> Franco-American </span>  dual citizen open to work opportunities in both the USA and the European Union.</p>

<p>I recently graduated from <span style="font-font-weight: bold; font-weight: 700;">EPITA School of Engineering and Computer Science </span> with a concentration in Image Processing and Synthesis.</p>

<p>Although my background is technical, I am <span style="color: black; font-size: 95%;">shifting</span> my focus toward opportunities beyond my majorâ€”thereâ€™s simply so much to explore.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve gained experience through internships: one as a full-stack developer at a startup, and another as a data scientist at a private bank.</p>

<p>I am also known for helping my relatives with tech-related stuff.</p>

<p>I have a particular interest in <span style="font-font-weight: bold; font-weight: 700;">VR</span> and its applications.</p>

<p>My hobbies include running, racket sports, chess, puzzles, games, and Asian culture.</p>

<p>Fun fact: I make good salad dressing.</p>
