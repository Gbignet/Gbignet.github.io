# My Journey at EPITA & Coding Projects

My four years at EPITA were an incredible experience. During my time as a student, I completed two internships, spent a semester studying in the heart of South Korea, and ultimately graduated with a master's degree in Computer Science.

As I reflect on this journey, I want to showcase the coding projects I worked on throughout my studies. Many of these projects are available on GitHub, highlighting my growth as a programmer.
