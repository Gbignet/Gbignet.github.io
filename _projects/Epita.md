# My Journey at EPITA & Coding Projects

My four years at EPITA were an incredible experience. During my time as a student, I completed two internships, spent a semester studying in the heart of South Korea, and ultimately graduated with a master's degree in Computer Science.

As I reflect on this journey, I want to showcase the coding projects I worked on throughout my studies. Many of these projects are available on GitHub, highlighting my growth as a programmer.

## The C Piscine – My First Challenge

The C Piscine was my introduction to EPITA’s intense learning system. For those unfamiliar, the Piscine (French for "swimming pool") is a brutal but rewarding coding bootcamp designed to push students to their limits. The focus was on the C language, which served as the foundation for all future coursework.

This was one of the toughest experiences of my studies. I had to adapt to long hours, an overwhelming workload, and strict constraints, such as limited push attempts for checking work using La Moulinette, the automated grading system. It was a test of endurance and problem-solving, but it built the foundation for everything that followed.

## Java Projects – Expanding My Skills

After mastering C, I moved on to Java, which introduced me to object-oriented programming. These projects ranged from algorithms and data structures to larger software applications, helping me understand abstraction, design patterns, and software architecture.

## JavaScript & Web Development

My journey wouldn’t be complete without JavaScript and web development. Learning JavaScript allowed me to build dynamic, interactive applications, and I explored frameworks like React and Node.js. These projects taught me how to create scalable front-end and back-end solutions.
